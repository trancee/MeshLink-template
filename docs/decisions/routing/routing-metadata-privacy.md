# Routing metadata privacy envelope and negotiation contract

This RFC defines the wire contract for protecting routing metadata in MeshLink,
including envelope format, versioning, capability negotiation, fallback
behavior, downgrade handling, and the machine-readable evidence required for the
next implementation slices.

## Scope

This contract covers routing-control metadata only. It does **not** redesign:

- trust or identity
- payload-layer application encryption
- product-level UX policy

## Goals

- protect route-control metadata from passive BLE observers when both peers
  support privacy mode
- preserve interoperability with legacy peers through explicit negotiation
- make fallback and downgrade outcomes machine-observable

## Baseline

Before this design, route-control payloads are plaintext `BabelRouteControlFrame`
values encoded by `BabelRouteFrameCodec` with wire types:

- `0x21` — UPDATE
- `0x22` — WITHDRAWAL

That leaves destination, next-hop, metric, and sequence metadata visible to a
nearby observer.

## Envelope design

### New frame types

To preserve backward compatibility and explicit negotiation, this design adds:

- `0x20` — `ROUTE_CAPS`
- `0x23` — `ROUTE_PRIVACY_ENVELOPE`

Legacy frame types `0x21` and `0x22` remain valid for negotiated fallback mode.

### `ROUTE_CAPS` (`0x20`)

`ROUTE_CAPS` is plaintext and intentionally small.

| Byte(s) | Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | `frame_type` | u8 | `0x20` |
| 1 | `version` | u8 | schema version, initial `1` |
| 2 | `capability_bits` | u8 | bit0 = supports privacy envelope v1 |
| 3 | `max_privacy_version` | u8 | highest supported privacy version |
| 4 | `min_privacy_version` | u8 | lowest supported privacy version |
| 5 | `flags` | u8 | reserved, must be `0` in v1 |

### `ROUTE_PRIVACY_ENVELOPE` (`0x23`)

`ROUTE_PRIVACY_ENVELOPE` carries an encrypted inner route-control frame.

| Byte(s) | Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | `frame_type` | u8 | `0x23` |
| 1 | `envelope_version` | u8 | initial `1` |
| 2 | `inner_frame_type` | u8 | `0x21` or `0x22` |
| 3 | `cipher_suite_id` | u8 | `0x01` = Noise-session AEAD default |
| 4 | `key_phase` | u8 | sender rekey epoch |
| 5..8 | `seq` | u32 LE | monotonic per-neighbour privacy sequence |
| 9 | `nonce_len` | u8 | v1 requires `12` |
| 10.. | `nonce` | bytes | AEAD nonce |
| next 2 | `ciphertext_len` | u16 LE | encrypted inner-frame length |
| next N | `ciphertext` | bytes | encrypted inner frame |
| next 16 | `tag` | bytes | AEAD tag |

The encrypted plaintext is exactly the existing `BabelRouteFrameCodec.encode(...)`
output for UPDATE or WITHDRAWAL, so route-table logic can stay intact after a
successful decrypt.

### Authenticated data (AAD)

AAD for v1 is:

`frame_type || envelope_version || inner_frame_type || cipher_suite_id || key_phase || seq || nonce_len`

That binds envelope metadata to ciphertext integrity.

## Version rules

- `ROUTE_CAPS.version` and `ROUTE_PRIVACY_ENVELOPE.envelope_version` are
  versioned independently
- unknown versions are hard parse failures for the offending frame
- privacy mode is valid only when both peers share at least one supported
  envelope version
- v1 selects envelope version `1`

## Capability negotiation

### Exchange timing

- after a Noise session is available for a neighbour, each side emits one
  `ROUTE_CAPS` frame
- capability state is bound to that session and cleared on disconnect or reset

### Deterministic mode selection

Per neighbour:

1. if local support and remote support overlap on privacy v1, select
   `privacy_v1`
2. otherwise, select `legacy` and record an explicit fallback reason

No implicit mode switching is allowed.

### Compatibility matrix

| Local | Remote | Selected mode | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| privacy_v1 | privacy_v1 | privacy_v1 | negotiated |
| privacy_v1 | legacy/none | legacy | `fallback_legacy_peer` |
| legacy/none | privacy_v1 | legacy | `fallback_local_legacy` |
| legacy/none | legacy/none | legacy | `fallback_both_legacy` |

## Fallback and downgrade rules

Fallback is valid only for explicit capability mismatch, not for parse,
decrypt, auth, or version failures.

Required fallback reasons:

- `fallback_legacy_peer`
- `fallback_local_legacy`
- `fallback_both_legacy`
- `fallback_local_policy`

Downgrade verdicts are separate:

- `none`
- `downgrade_suspected`
- `downgrade_detected`

Deterministic v1 rules:

1. if privacy was negotiated and a legacy route frame arrives afterward, flag
   downgrade (`suspected` first, then `detected` on repeat or threshold breach)
2. if a privacy-capable peer sends an unsupported or rolled-back envelope
   version, mark `downgrade_detected`
3. if envelope auth or decrypt fails after privacy negotiation, mark
   `downgrade_detected`
4. benign capability-mismatch fallback keeps `downgrade=none`

Privacy mode is fail-closed: auth, decrypt, and version failures drop the frame
and do not silently switch the session to legacy mode.

## Diagnostics contract

S02/S03 must expose machine-readable diagnostics for at least:

- `route.negotiated_mode`
- `route.fallback_reason`
- `route.downgrade_verdict`
- `route.envelope_version`
- `route.envelope_failure` when applicable

Those fields may extend the current routing diagnostics or use a dedicated
routing-privacy payload, but they must stay acceptance-projectable.

## Acceptance evidence contract

S03 closeout bundles must include machine-readable evidence for:

- privacy-envelope counts on both legs
- negotiated-mode counts
- fallback-reason counts
- suspected/detected downgrade counts
- legacy compatibility application
- attack-path legacy drop behavior

The acceptance runner should fail closed when required fields are missing,
malformed, or inconsistent with the claimed scenario.

## Deterministic test vectors

### Test vector 1 — `ROUTE_CAPS` advertises privacy v1

Hex:

`20 01 01 01 01 00`

Meaning:

- frame type `0x20`
- schema version `0x01`
- capability bit0 set
- max/min privacy version `0x01`
- flags `0x00`

### Test vector 2 — negotiated privacy success

Input:

- local caps: `20 01 01 01 01 00`
- remote caps: `20 01 01 01 01 00`

Expected:

- `negotiated_mode=privacy_v1`
- `fallback_reason=none`
- `downgrade_verdict=none`

### Test vector 3 — benign fallback with a legacy peer

Input:

- local caps: `20 01 01 01 01 00`
- remote caps: absent

Expected:

- `negotiated_mode=legacy`
- `fallback_reason=fallback_legacy_peer`
- `downgrade_verdict=none`

### Test vector 4 — legacy frame after privacy negotiation

Input:

- prior state: `negotiated_mode=privacy_v1`
- received frame type: `0x21`

Expected:

- `downgrade_verdict=downgrade_suspected` on the first violation
- escalation to `downgrade_detected` on repeat
- offending frame dropped per policy

## Implementation note

The route-table semantics should stay unchanged: decrypt the envelope first,
then pass the inner payload through the existing route-frame decode/application
flow.
