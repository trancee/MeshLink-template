<essential_principles>

**Core Bluetooth** — Apple's framework for BLE and BR/EDR Classic communication. Central role scans and connects; peripheral role advertises and hosts services.

Available: iOS 5+, macOS 10.10+, tvOS 9+, visionOS 1+, watchOS 4+ (advertising not available on watchOS/tvOS/visionOS).

**Never subclass** any Core Bluetooth class — results in undefined behavior.

### Info.plist Requirements

```xml
<!-- Required iOS 13+ — app crashes without it -->
<key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app uses Bluetooth to communicate with nearby devices.</string>

<!-- Background modes (if needed) -->
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>bluetooth-central</string>     <!-- scan/connect in background -->
    <string>bluetooth-peripheral</string>  <!-- advertise in background -->
</array>
```

### State Management — CRITICAL

```swift
// Must wait for .poweredOn before calling ANY method
func centralManagerDidUpdateState(_ central: CBCentralManager) {
    guard central.state == .poweredOn else { return }
    // Now safe to scan, connect, etc.
}
```

`CBManagerState`: `.unknown`, `.resetting`, `.unsupported`, `.unauthorized`, `.poweredOff`, `.poweredOn`

### Central Role — End-to-End

```swift
// 1. Create central manager
let central = CBCentralManager(delegate: self, queue: nil)

// 2. Scan (after .poweredOn)
central.scanForPeripherals(withServices: [serviceUUID])

// 3. Discover → connect
func centralManager(_ central: CBCentralManager, didDiscover peripheral: CBPeripheral, ...) {
    self.peripheral = peripheral  // retain!
    central.connect(peripheral)
}

// 4. Connected → discover services
func centralManager(_ central: CBCentralManager, didConnect peripheral: CBPeripheral) {
    peripheral.delegate = self
    peripheral.discoverServices([serviceUUID])
}

// 5. Services → characteristics
func peripheral(_ peripheral: CBPeripheral, didDiscoverServices error: Error?) {
    for service in peripheral.services ?? [] {
        peripheral.discoverCharacteristics([charUUID], for: service)
    }
}

// 6. Read/write/subscribe
func peripheral(_ peripheral: CBPeripheral, didDiscoverCharacteristicsFor service: CBService, ...) {
    for char in service.characteristics ?? [] {
        peripheral.readValue(for: char)
        peripheral.setNotifyValue(true, for: char)  // subscribe
    }
}

// 7. Receive data
func peripheral(_ peripheral: CBPeripheral, didUpdateValueFor characteristic: CBCharacteristic, ...) {
    let data = characteristic.value  // the data
}
```

### Peripheral Role — End-to-End

```swift
// 1. Create peripheral manager
let peripheralManager = CBPeripheralManager(delegate: self, queue: nil)

// 2. Build and add service (after .poweredOn)
let char = CBMutableCharacteristic(
    type: charUUID,
    properties: [.read, .write, .notify],
    value: nil,  // nil = dynamic value via delegate
    permissions: [.readable, .writeable]
)
let service = CBMutableService(type: serviceUUID, primary: true)
service.characteristics = [char]
peripheralManager.add(service)

// 3. Advertise
peripheralManager.startAdvertising([
    CBAdvertisementDataLocalNameKey: "MyDevice",
    CBAdvertisementDataServiceUUIDsKey: [serviceUUID]
])

// 4. Handle read requests
func peripheralManager(_ peripheral: CBPeripheralManager, didReceiveRead request: CBATTRequest) {
    request.value = myData.subdata(in: request.offset..<myData.count)
    peripheral.respond(to: request, withResult: .success)
}

// 5. Handle write requests
func peripheralManager(_ peripheral: CBPeripheralManager, didReceiveWrite requests: [CBATTRequest]) {
    for request in requests {
        // process request.value
    }
    peripheral.respond(to: requests[0], withResult: .success)
}

// 6. Send notifications
let didSend = peripheralManager.updateValue(data, for: char, onSubscribedCentrals: nil)
// if false → queue full, wait for peripheralManagerIsReadyToUpdateSubscribers
```

### Key Rules

1. **Retain `CBPeripheral`** after discovery — framework does not retain it for you
2. **Wait for `.poweredOn`** before calling any manager methods
3. **`updateValue` returns `false`** when the transmit queue is full — stop sending and wait for `peripheralManagerIsReadyToUpdateSubscribers` callback
4. **Respond to EVERY read/write request** with `respond(to:withResult:)` — timeout if you don't
5. **Background**: scanning limited to service UUIDs only, no duplicate reporting, system coalesces events
6. **iOS 26+**: Live Activity keeps foreground-level BLE privileges in background
7. **Check `CBManager.authorization`** before instantiating a manager if you just need to know whether Bluetooth access is denied/restricted — avoids triggering the permission prompt prematurely
8. **Channel Sounding (beta, iOS 27+)**: precise BLE 6.3 distance ranging requires the peripheral be paired via `AccessorySetupKit` — sessions with peripherals paired any other way are refused

**programming-guide.md** — Core Bluetooth Programming Guide from Apple Documentation Archive. Conceptual overview (GATT data hierarchy: peripheral contains services which contain characteristics which contain descriptors; central-side immutable CBService/CBCharacteristic vs peripheral-side CBMutableService/CBMutableCharacteristic). Central role step-by-step in Objective-C (initWithDelegate:queue:options: creates CBCentralManager, centralManagerDidUpdateState: required callback must check poweredOn, scanForPeripheralsWithServices:options: with nil discovers all or pass CBUUID array, centralManager:didDiscoverPeripheral:advertisementData:RSSI: must retain peripheral in property, connectPeripheral:options:, centralManager:didConnectPeripheral: sets peripheral.delegate then calls discoverServices: with specific UUIDs, peripheral:didDiscoverServices: iterates services and calls discoverCharacteristics:forService: with specific UUIDs, peripheral:didDiscoverCharacteristicsForService: then readValueForCharacteristic: or setNotifyValue:YES, peripheral:didUpdateValueForCharacteristic:error: delivers data for both reads and notifications, writeValue:forCharacteristic:type: with CBCharacteristicWriteWithResponse or CBCharacteristicWriteWithoutResponse, check characteristic.properties before operating). Peripheral role step-by-step (initWithDelegate:queue:options: creates CBPeripheralManager, peripheralManagerDidUpdateState: required, CBUUID UUIDWithString: for 16-bit SIG or 128-bit custom UUIDs, generate with uuidgen, CBMutableCharacteristic initWithType:properties:value:permissions: where value:nil means DYNAMIC with delegate callbacks and value:non-nil means STATIC cached permanently — critical distinction, CBMutableService initWithType:primary: with characteristics array, addService: then wait for peripheralManager:didAddService:error:, startAdvertising: with CBAdvertisementDataLocalNameKey and CBAdvertisementDataServiceUUIDsKey only two keys honored, peripheralManager:didReceiveReadRequest: must check offset and respond, peripheralManager:didReceiveWriteRequests: receives array and respondToRequest:withResult: to FIRST request only, updateValue:forCharacteristic:onSubscribedCentrals: returns BOOL false when queue full then wait for peripheralManagerIsReadyToUpdateSubscribers:). Background processing (foreground-only apps: central cannot scan, peripheral advertising disabled, events queued until foreground; CBConnectPeripheralOptionNotifyOnConnectionKey/DisconnectionKey/NotificationKey for system alerts while suspended; UIBackgroundModes bluetooth-central enables scan/connect/events in background, bluetooth-peripheral enables advertise/respond; background limitations: AllowDuplicatesKey ignored, scan requires service UUIDs, discovery events batched, advertising reduced to overflow area with no local name; state preservation and restoration iOS 7+: step 1 provide CBCentralManagerOptionRestoreIdentifierKey or CBPeripheralManagerOptionRestoreIdentifierKey in init options using same identifier every time, step 2 reinstantiate managers in application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: using UIApplicationLaunchOptionsBluetoothCentralsKey/BluetoothPeripheralsKey, step 3 implement centralManager:willRestoreState: or peripheralManager:willRestoreState: to reassign delegates and process restored peripherals/services using CBCentralManagerRestoredStatePeripheralsKey/ScanServicesKey/ScanOptionsKey or CBPeripheralManagerRestoredStateServicesKey/AdvertisementDataKey, step 4 update centralManagerDidUpdateState: to avoid duplicating work already restored). Best practices central (stop scanning immediately after finding target, never AllowDuplicatesKey unless per-packet RSSI needed, discover only needed services and characteristics via specific CBUUID arrays, subscribe setNotifyValue:YES instead of polling readValueForCharacteristic: for changing data, disconnect cancelPeripheralConnection: when done, three reconnection strategies in order: retrievePeripheralsWithIdentifiers: by saved UUID for direct connect without scanning, retrieveConnectedPeripheralsWithServices: for system-connected peripherals, scan as last resort). Best practices peripheral (advertising limited to CBAdvertisementDataLocalNameKey + CBAdvertisementDataServiceUUIDsKey, foreground budget 28 bytes initial + 10 bytes scan response for local name + 2 bytes header per type, overflow area for UUIDs that don't fit — only found by iOS explicit scan, background: no local name advertised all UUIDs in overflow, stop advertising once connected, provide UI for user-controlled advertising, always add CBCharacteristicPropertyNotify to characteristics that change, protect sensitive data with CBAttributePermissionsReadEncryptionRequired/WriteEncryptionRequired which triggers automatic pairing).
