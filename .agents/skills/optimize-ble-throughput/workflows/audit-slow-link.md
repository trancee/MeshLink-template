1. Gather evidence before theorizing: measured throughput, device and OS, central/peripheral roles, negotiated ATT MTU, PHY, DLE state, connection interval, peripheral latency, packet or chunk size, operation type, directionality, simultaneous connections, advertising state, RSSI or field conditions, and any logs or sniffer traces.
2. Classify the symptom:
   - only 20-byte payloads -> default ATT path or no DLE benefit reaching the app
   - around 182 bytes on iOS writes -> often expected CoreBluetooth payload on ATT MTU 185 paths
   - throughput capped around **54 kB/s** -> no effective DLE, still using request/indication-style operations, or default-MTU behavior
   - 244-byte or 495-byte chunks but low kbps -> packets per event, buffering, connection interval, reverse traffic, or mobile airtime limits
   - about one useful message every one or two connection events -> write requests, indications, or application stop-and-wait behavior
   - 2M requested but no speedup -> still on 1M, too few packets per event, or RF conditions are poor
   - bench results good but field results poor -> retransmissions, interference, or 2M range limits
   - strong single-link results but weak multi-link or advertising-on results -> airtime splitting across other BLE work
   - good one-way performance but poor bidirectional performance -> half-duplex contention
3. Use logs or a sniffer to verify MTU exchange, LL length update, PHY update, packets per connection event, and whether ATT messages fragment across more LL packets than expected.
4. Check for host-side throttling or drops: queue starvation, application stop-and-wait behavior, slow processing between events, insufficient buffers, extra BLE links, advertising airtime, or stack-specific operation limits.
5. Name the most likely root cause, cite the evidence, and propose the next single experiment that would confirm or disprove it.

<success_criteria>
This workflow is complete when:
- the response points to a specific limiting factor
- the diagnosis is evidence-based, not speculative
- the next test is narrow enough to confirm the hypothesis
- the user knows what measurement to collect if evidence is still missing
