name: dtls13-rfc9147
description: RFC 9147 — DTLS 1.3 protocol reference. Covers record layer (DTLSPlaintext/DTLSCiphertext, unified header with C/S/L/E flags, minimal 2-byte header), sequence numbers and epochs (per-epoch numbering, RecordNumber for AEAD nonce, KeyUpdate increments, record number encryption via AES-ECB/ChaCha20 masks with sn_key). Anti-replay via sliding bitmap window (per-epoch, deprotect-before-advance, timing channel avoidance). AEAD usage limits per algorithm for confidentiality and integrity. DoS cookie exchange, retransmission with exponential backoff, key updates with ACK, Connection ID management. Use when implementing DTLS 1.3, building replay protection, understanding AEAD key rotation limits, or any RFC 9147 question.

**RFC 9147** defines DTLS 1.3 — TLS 1.3 adapted for datagram transport. IETF Standards Track (April 2022). Obsoletes RFC 6347.

### What an Implementer Must Know

**Record layer:** DTLSCiphertext uses a compact unified header (first byte: `001CSLEE`). Sequence numbers are explicit (8 or 16 bits on wire, reconstructed to 64-bit). Record numbers are encrypted using AES-ECB or ChaCha20 masks with per-epoch `sn_key`. Full 128-bit `{epoch, sequence_number}` is the AEAD nonce.

**Anti-replay:** Optional sliding bitmap window per epoch (from IPsec ESP RFC 4303). Right edge = highest validated seq. Below left edge → discard. Within window → check bitmap, discard duplicates. Right of window → new, advance. **Window MUST NOT advance until record successfully deprotected.** Replay check SHOULD happen after deprotection (timing channel). Invalid records silently discarded (no alert over UDP).

**AEAD limits — DTLS-specific:** TLS closes on any auth failure (trivial limit). DTLS silently discards → attacker gets multiple forgery attempts → explicit limits: AES-GCM/ChaCha20 can fail 2^36 times, AES-CCM 2^23.5, AES-CCM-8 **MUST NOT** be used without extra protections (forgery limit only 2^7). Confidentiality limits also apply (initiate key update before reaching).

**Key updates:** Epoch increments on KeyUpdate (MUST be ACKed). MUST NOT send with new keys until ACK received. Retain old keys until new keys confirmed. Epoch MUST NOT exceed 2^48-1.

**DoS prevention:** Cookie exchange via HelloRetryRequest — cookie depends on client address, unforgeable. Servers SHOULD use unless amplification not a threat.
