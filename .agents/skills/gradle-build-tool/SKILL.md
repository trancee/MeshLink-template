description: Gradle build tool reference for configuring builds, managing dependencies, writing tasks, and optimizing build performance. Covers Kotlin DSL, build scripts, settings files, version catalogs, multi-project builds, plugins, the build lifecycle, CLI commands, and caching. Use when writing or editing Gradle build files, debugging build failures, adding dependencies, configuring plugins, setting up multi-project builds, or asked about Gradle features like "how do I add a dependency", "what's the build lifecycle", "how do multi-project builds work", or "how to speed up Gradle builds".

**Gradle** automates building, testing, and deployment using build scripts written in Kotlin DSL (`.gradle.kts`) or Groovy DSL (`.gradle`). Prefer Kotlin DSL for type safety and IDE support. Current stable: **9.6.1**; Gradle 9 adopted Semantic Versioning (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`), requires **Java 17+ to run the daemon** (project code can still target older Java via toolchains), and embeds Kotlin 2.2 / Groovy 4 for build logic.

### Core Rules an Agent Must Know

- **Always use the wrapper** (`./gradlew`, not `gradle`). It ensures consistent Gradle version across environments.
- **Three build phases:** Initialization (find projects) → Configuration (evaluate build scripts, build task graph) → Execution (run tasks). Code in `doLast {}` / `doFirst {}` runs in execution; code directly in task config runs in configuration.
- **`implementation` by default.** Use `api` only when a dependency's types appear in your library's public API. Use `compileOnly` for annotation processors and compile-time-only deps.
- **Version catalogs** (`gradle/libs.versions.toml`) centralize dependency versions. Reference via `libs.some.library` in build scripts.
- **Incremental builds** — Gradle skips tasks whose inputs/outputs haven't changed (`UP-TO-DATE`). Always declare task inputs/outputs.
- **`plugins {}` block** is the preferred way to apply plugins. Use `alias(libs.plugins.x)` with version catalogs.
- **Multi-project builds** use `include()` in `settings.gradle.kts`. Cross-project deps via `project(":subproject")`.
- **Convention plugins** (in `buildSrc/` or `build-logic/`) share build logic across subprojects — don't repeat configuration.
- **Configuration Cache is now the preferred execution mode** (since Gradle 9.0). Enable it in `gradle.properties`: `org.gradle.configuration-cache=true`, alongside `org.gradle.parallel=true` and `org.gradle.caching=true`. If it's off and no known incompatibilities exist, Gradle will actively prompt you to enable it; when a build hits an unsupported feature, Gradle falls back gracefully instead of failing (check the configuration cache report for why).

<routing>

Based on what you need, read the appropriate reference:

| Topic | Reference |
|-------|-----------|
| Project structure, settings file, build file, wrapper, `gradle.properties` | `references/core-concepts.md` |
| Build lifecycle (init/config/exec), tasks, custom tasks, incremental builds | `references/lifecycle-and-tasks.md` |
| Dependencies, configurations, version catalog, repositories, constraints | `references/dependencies.md` |
| Plugins, Kotlin DSL tips, multi-project builds, convention plugins, composite builds | `references/plugins-and-config.md` |
| CLI commands, flags, performance tuning, caching, daemon, troubleshooting | `references/cli-and-performance.md` |

For general Gradle tasks, read `references/core-concepts.md` first — it covers the foundational structure. Load additional references as needed.

All domain knowledge in `references/`:

**Core:** core-concepts.md — project structure, settings file, build file, wrapper (incl. partial-version resolution, daemon toolchain / `gradle-daemon-jvm.properties`), gradle.properties, core concepts table
**Lifecycle:** lifecycle-and-tasks.md — three build phases, running tasks, common tasks, registering custom tasks, inputs/outputs, up-to-date checks, `--task-graph` visualization, reproducible archives by default
**Dependencies:** dependencies.md — declaring deps, configurations table, version catalog (libs.versions.toml), repositories, inspecting deps, constraints, conflict resolution
**Plugins:** plugins-and-config.md — applying plugins, common plugins table, Kotlin DSL tips, multi-project builds, convention plugins, composite builds
**CLI:** cli-and-performance.md — essential commands, useful flags (incl. `--task-graph`, `--console=colored`), task abbreviation, build cache, config cache (now the preferred execution mode with prompt-to-enable and graceful fallback), parallel execution, daemon, troubleshooting
