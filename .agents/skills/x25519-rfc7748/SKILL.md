name: x25519-rfc7748
description: RFC 7748 — Elliptic Curves for Security reference. Specifies Curve25519 and Curve448 in Montgomery form, the X25519 and X448 scalar multiplication functions (Montgomery ladder, constant-time), scalar clamping (cofactor clearing, high-bit), u-coordinate encoding (little-endian, non-canonical accepted), Diffie-Hellman key agreement. Equivalent Edwards curves (edwards25519/edwards448 with birational/4-isogeny maps). Side-channel considerations (constant operation sequence, no data-dependent branches). Security properties (small-order points, all-zero output check). Deterministic curve generation and test vectors. Use when implementing X25519/X448, Curve25519/448 scalar multiplication, DH key exchange, scalar clamping, Montgomery↔Edwards mapping, or any RFC 7748 question.

**RFC 7748** defines Curve25519, Curve448, and their X25519/X448 scalar multiplication functions for Diffie-Hellman key agreement. IRTF Informational (Jan 2016).

### What an Implementer Must Know

**Two curves:** Curve25519 (p=2^255−19, ~128-bit, cofactor 8, base u=9, 32-byte keys) and Curve448 (p=2^448−2^224−1, ~224-bit, cofactor 4, base u=5, 56-byte keys). Montgomery form v²=u³+Au²+u.

**Scalar clamping:** X25519: clear bottom 3 bits (÷8 cofactor), clear bit 255, set bit 254. X448: clear bottom 2 bits (÷4 cofactor), set bit 447. This ensures constant-time scalar multiplication and prime-order subgroup membership.

**X25519/X448 function:** Takes scalar k + u-coordinate → output u-coordinate. Montgomery ladder processes bits top-to-bottom with constant-time cswap. Final inversion via Fermat (z^(p−2)). All little-endian. X25519 MUST mask bit 255 of input u. MUST accept non-canonical values (≥p), reducing mod p.

**Diffie-Hellman:** Alice sends X25519(a, 9), Bob sends X25519(b, 9). Shared secret K = X25519(a, K_B) = X25519(b, K_A). MAY check for all-zero output (small-order input eliminates other party's contribution). Use KDF including K, K_A, K_B.

**Edwards equivalents:** edwards25519 (twisted, a=−1, d=−121665/121666) is birationally equivalent to Curve25519 — used by Ed25519. edwards448 (untwisted, a=1, d=−39081) is 4-isogenous to Curve448 — used by Ed448.

**Constant-time:** Same field operations for every scalar value. cswap via bitwise mask. No data-dependent branches, jumps, or memory accesses.
